# MetaSignet: Human Content Verification for Bluesky
## Project Proposal

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal presents MetaSignet, an innovative human content verification system designed to address the growing challenge of distinguishing between human-created and AI-generated content on social media platforms, with specific integration for Bluesky. By combining a user-friendly Streamlit interface with blockchain verification technology, MetaSignet provides an accessible yet powerful mechanism for creators to verify the human origin of their digital content.

MetaSignet implements a self-attestation and social vouching system that allows content creators to declare their work as human-created and build trust through community verification. The solution leverages the AT Protocol to integrate directly with Bluesky, providing a seamless verification experience that fits into creators' existing workflows.

The hybrid approach balances accessibility with security, allowing non-technical users to benefit from content verification while providing stronger blockchain-based verification for those who desire it. Beyond mere verification, MetaSignet creates a community-driven trust layer that celebrates and distinguishes human creativity in an increasingly AI-dominated content landscape.

## 2. Problem Statement and Background

### 2.1 Problem Domain

The rapid advancement of AI content generation tools has created a crisis of authenticity on social media platforms. This problem is particularly relevant for emerging platforms like Bluesky that emphasize creator ownership and authenticity. Key challenges include:

1. **Content Authenticity Confusion**: Increasingly difficult to distinguish between human and AI-generated content
2. **Creative Devaluation**: Human creative work loses value when indistinguishable from AI outputs
3. **Attribution Issues**: Original human creators struggle to claim ownership of their work
4. **Trust Deficit**: Audiences increasingly skeptical about the authenticity of digital content
5. **Platform Limitations**: Social platforms lack built-in mechanisms to verify human creation

### 2.2 Market Need

The need for human content verification is growing rapidly:

- **AI Content Proliferation**: Text, image, and audio creation tools are becoming increasingly sophisticated
- **Creator Economy Impact**: Human creators are competing with AI-generated content
- **Audience Value Shift**: Growing audience preference for knowing when content is human-created
- **Platform Trust Challenges**: Social media platforms struggling with verification challenges
- **Bluesky Opportunity**: New platform focused on authenticity is ideal for pioneering this approach

### 2.3 Why Blockchain + Streamlit?

The hybrid approach offers significant advantages:

- **Accessibility**: Streamlit provides a familiar, web-based interface accessible to non-technical users
- **Progressive Adoption**: Users can begin with simple verification and adopt blockchain as desired
- **Immutable Records**: Blockchain provides tamper-proof verification history
- **Community Mechanisms**: Smart contracts enable trustless social vouching
- **Direct Integration**: AT Protocol integration brings verification directly to the Bluesky ecosystem

## 3. User Experience Design

### 3.1 Core User Flows

MetaSignet offers a streamlined user experience built around three key activities:

**1. Authentication Flow**
- Users visit metasignet.app and click "Sign in with Bluesky"
- They enter their Bluesky credentials or app password
- MetaSignet authenticates via the AT Protocol
- No separate account creation needed - their Bluesky identity is their MetaSignet identity

**2. Content Verification Flow**
- User selects a post from their Bluesky feed or enters a post URL
- MetaSignet displays the post content and asks about creation method
- User selects "Entirely by me (human)" and confirms authenticity
- Optionally, user adds context about their creative process
- MetaSignet generates a content fingerprint and records the attestation
- A verification certificate is generated and displayed

**3. Social Vouching Flow**
- User views verification requests from their Bluesky connections
- For each request, they can view the content and choose to vouch
- User clicks "Vouch as Human" to confirm they believe the content is human-created
- After receiving multiple vouches, content verification status upgrades to "Human-verified+"

### 3.2 Interface Design

The MetaSignet interface is organized into three main tabs:

**Feed Tab**
- Displays the user's Bluesky posts with verification status indicators
- Unverified, Human-verified (self-attested), and Human-verified+ (community vouched) statuses
- One-click access to verify unverified content

**Verify Tab**
- Form to enter Bluesky post URL
- Display of post content and images
- Creation type selection (human, AI-assisted, AI-generated)
- Confirmation checkbox for human attestation
- Optional creation context input
- Verification certificate display

**Community Tab**
- List of verification requests from connections
- Interface to view content and vouch for human creation
- Personal vouching history
- Community impact metrics

### 3.3 Verification Certificate

The verification certificate serves as both proof and promotion of human-created content:

- **Visual Design**: Clean, professional appearance with MetaSignet branding
- **Content Details**: Post preview, content hash, timestamp, creator information
- **Verification Level**: Clear indication of self-attested vs. community vouched
- **Blockchain Record**: Transaction ID for blockchain-verified content
- **Shareable Link**: Short URL for sharing verification status (meta.sg/verify/[hash])
- **Embed Code**: HTML/image code for embedding verification badge on websites

## 4. System Design and Architecture

### 4.1 Technology Stack

MetaSignet utilizes the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python-based web application framework)

4. **Blockchain Layer** (optional):
   - Smart contracts for verification logic
   - Immutable verification records
   - Decentralized vouching system
   - Transaction management

### 4.3 Data Structures

The system implements the following key data structures:

**Content Verification Record**:
```solidity
struct Content {
    address creator;             // Address of the content creator
    string contentHash;          // Unique hash identifying the content
    string contentURI;           // URI of the content (e.g., Bluesky post URL)
    uint256 timestamp;           // When the content was registered
    CreationType creationType;   // How the content was created
    VerificationStatus status;   // Current verification status
    string creationContext;      // Optional context about the creation process
    uint256 vouchCount;          // Number of community vouches received
    string platformSource;       // Platform where content originated
}
```

**Creation Types**:
```solidity
enum CreationType { 
    UNDECLARED,      // Default state
    HUMAN_CREATED,   // Content created entirely by human
    AI_ASSISTED,     // Human created with AI tools
    AI_GENERATED     // Primarily AI-generated
}
```

**Verification Status Levels**:
```solidity
enum VerificationStatus {
    UNVERIFIED,       // Not yet verified
    SELF_ATTESTED,    // Creator has self-attested
    COMMUNITY_VOUCHED // Has received community vouching
}
```

### 4.4 Content Fingerprinting

The content fingerprinting system creates unique, reproducible identifiers for content:

1. **Text Fingerprinting**: Hash generation from text content
2. **Image Fingerprinting**: Perceptual hash generation resilient to minor modifications
3. **Combined Fingerprint**: Unified hash combining all content elements
4. **Verification Lookup**: Fast retrieval of verification status by content hash

### 4.5 Security Considerations

The system implements several security measures:

1. **Bluesky Authentication**: Secure handling of Bluesky credentials
2. **Content Ownership Verification**: Ensures only the content creator can verify
3. **Sybil Resistance**: Social graph-based vouching limits fake accounts' impact
4. **Immutable Records**: Blockchain verification prevents history alterations
5. **Progressive Security**: Multiple verification levels with increasing security

## 5. Implementation Details

### 5.1 Smart Contract Design

The MetaSignet smart contract implements:

1. **Content Registration**:
   ```solidity
   function registerContent(
       string memory contentHash,
       string memory contentURI,
       CreationType creationType,
       string memory platformSource,
       string memory creationContext
   ) public payable {
       // Validation
       require(msg.value >= registrationFee, "Insufficient registration fee");
       require(verifiedContent[contentHash].timestamp == 0, "Content already registered");
       
       // Create new content record
       Content storage newContent = verifiedContent[contentHash];
       newContent.creator = msg.sender;
       newContent.contentHash = contentHash;
       newContent.contentURI = contentURI;
       newContent.timestamp = block.timestamp;
       newContent.creationType = creationType;
       newContent.status = VerificationStatus.SELF_ATTESTED;
       newContent.creationContext = creationContext;
       newContent.vouchCount = 0;
       newContent.platformSource = platformSource;
       
       // Add to creator's content list
       creatorContent[msg.sender].push(contentHash);
       
       // Handle registration fee
       if (msg.value > 0) {
           payable(feeCollector).transfer(msg.value);
       }
       
       // Emit events
       emit ContentRegistered(contentHash, msg.sender, contentURI, creationType);
       emit VerificationStatusUpdated(contentHash, VerificationStatus.SELF_ATTESTED);
   }
   ```

2. **Social Vouching**:
   ```solidity
   function vouchForContent(string memory contentHash) 
       public 
       contentExists(contentHash) 
       hasNotVouched(contentHash) 
   {
       require(verifiedContent[contentHash].creator != msg.sender, "Cannot vouch for your own content");
       require(verifiedContent[contentHash].creationType == CreationType.HUMAN_CREATED, 
               "Can only vouch for human-created content");
       
       // Record the vouch
       contentVouches[contentHash][msg.sender] = true;
       verifiedContent[contentHash].vouchCount += 1;
       
       emit ContentVouched(contentHash, msg.sender);
       
       // Update verification status if threshold reached
       if (verifiedContent[contentHash].vouchCount >= vouchThreshold && 
           verifiedContent[contentHash].status == VerificationStatus.SELF_ATTESTED) {
           verifiedContent[contentHash].status = VerificationStatus.COMMUNITY_VOUCHED;
           emit VerificationStatusUpdated(contentHash, VerificationStatus.COMMUNITY_VOUCHED);
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Verification Status Checking**:
   ```solidity
   function isHumanVerified(string memory contentHash) 
       public 
       view 
       returns (bool isHuman, VerificationStatus verificationLevel) 
   {
       Content storage content = verifiedContent[contentHash];
       bool isHumanContent = (content.creationType == CreationType.HUMAN_CREATED);
       
       return (isHumanContent, content.status);
   }
   ```

### 5.2 Streamlit Implementation

The Streamlit frontend implements:

1. **Bluesky Authentication**:
   ```python
   def login_bluesky(self, username, password):
       """Login to Bluesky"""
       try:
           self.client.login(username, password)
           # Store login state
           st.session_state.is_logged_in = True
           st.session_state.bluesky_client = self.client
           st.session_state.bluesky_username = username
           return True
       except Exception as e:
           st.error(f"Login failed: {str(e)}")
           return False
   ```

2. **Content Fetching**:
   ```python
   def get_post_details(self, post_uri):
       """Fetch post details and images from a Bluesky post"""
       # Implementation for AT Protocol integration
       # Fetch post content, metadata, and images
   ```

3. **Content Fingerprinting**:
   ```python
   def compute_content_hash(self, post_details):
       """Compute hash of content based on text and images"""
       # Generate text hash
       # Generate image perceptual hashes
       # Combine into unified content fingerprint
   ```

4. **Human Verification**:
   ```python
   def verify_human_content(self, content_hash, post_uri, creation_type, creation_context=""):
       """Register content as human-created"""
       # Implement verification process
       # Optional blockchain integration

## 5. Interaction Patterns

### 5.1 Verification Status Progression

**Visual progression of verification status**:
1. Unverified (gray) → 
2. Human-verified (green) → 
3. Human-verified+ (green with added indicators)

**Interactions to change status**:
- Self-attestation: Creator verifies own content as human-created
- Community vouching: Other users vouch for content's human origin
- Status upgrade: Automatic when threshold of vouches reached

### 5.2 Contextual Actions

Each content piece has relevant actions based on its state:

**Unverified Content**:
- "Verify as Human" (for creator's own content)
- "View on Bluesky" (for any content)

**Self-Attested Content**:
- "View Certificate" 
- "Share Certificate"
- "Vouch for This" (for others' content)

**Community-Vouched Content**:
- "View Certificate"
- "Share Certificate"
- "See Vouches" (shows who has vouched)

### 5.3 Progressive Disclosure

Information is revealed progressively to avoid overwhelming users:

1. **Basic Information**: Initially shown for all content
   - Creator name
   - Content snippet
   - Verification status
   
2. **Verification Details**: Revealed on interaction
   - Content hash
   - Timestamp
   - Verification method
   
3. **Technical Details**: Available through "Advanced" expander
   - Blockchain transaction (if applicable)
   - Hash generation method
   - Vouch record details

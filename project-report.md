   function registerContent(
       string memory contentHash,
       string memory platformSource,
       string memory contentType,
       string memory originalUrl
   ) public payable {
       require(msg.value >= registrationFee, "Insufficient registration fee");
       require(verifiedContent[contentHash].creator == address(0), "Content already registered");
       
       Content storage newContent = verifiedContent[contentHash];
       newContent.creator = msg.sender;
       newContent.contentHash = contentHash;
       newContent.timestamp = block.timestamp;
       newContent.isVerified = false;
       newContent.platformSource = platformSource;
       newContent.contentType = contentType;
       newContent.originalUrl = originalUrl;
       newContent.isDisputed = false;
       newContent.authorizedUsers[msg.sender] = true;
       
       creatorContent[msg.sender].push(contentHash);
       
       payable(feeCollector).transfer(msg.value);
       
       emit ContentRegistered(contentHash, msg.sender, originalUrl);
   }
   ```

2. **Trusted Oracle Verification**:
   ```solidity
   function verifyContent(string memory contentHash) public onlyTrustedOracle contentExists(contentHash) {
       verifiedContent[contentHash].isVerified = true;
       emit ContentVerified(contentHash, msg.sender);
   }
   ```

3. **Progressive Web3 Adoption Support**:
   ```solidity
   function preRegisterContentForUser(
       string memory contentHash,
       string memory platformSource,
       string memory contentType,
       string memory originalUrl,
       address creator
   ) public onlyTrustedOracle {
       require(verifiedContent[contentHash].creator == address(0), "Content already registered");
       // Register content for users without wallets
       // Implementation continues...
   }
   ```

### 4.2 Streamlit Implementation

The Streamlit frontend implements:

1. **Bluesky Authentication**:
   ```python
   def login_bluesky(self, username, password):
       """Login to Bluesky"""
       try:
           self.client.login(username, password)
           # Store login state
           st.session_state.is_logged_in = True
           st.session_state.bluesky_client = self.client
           st.session_state.bluesky_username = username
           return True
       except Exception as e:
           st.error(f"Login failed: {str(e)}")
           return False
   ```

2. **Content Fetching**:
   ```python
   def get_post_images(self, post_uri):
       """Fetch images from a Bluesky post"""
       # Implementation for fetching post content from Bluesky
       # Using atproto client to access Bluesky API
   ```

3. **Image Processing**:
   ```python
   def compute_image_hash(self, image):
       """Compute perceptual hash of image"""
       if isinstance(image, bytes):
           image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(image))
       return str(imagehash.average_hash(image))
   ```

4. **Dual Verification Paths**:
   ```python
   # Blockchain registration
   def register_on_blockchain(self, content_hash, platform, content_type, url):
       """Register content hash on blockchain"""
       # Implementation for Web3 transaction
       
   # Local registration fallback
   def register_locally(self, content_hash, platform, content_type, url):
       """Register content in local database when blockchain not available"""
